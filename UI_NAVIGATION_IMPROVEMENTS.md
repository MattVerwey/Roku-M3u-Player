# UI Navigation Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the UI navigation and content organization in the M3U Player application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Home Page Restructuring

**Before:**
- Home page showed all content categories mixed together
- Live TV, Movies, and Series categories were all displayed as rows on the home page
- No clear separation between personalized content and browsing

**After:**
- Home page now focuses on personalized content discovery:
  - **Recently Watched**: Up to 20 recently viewed items
  - **Recommended For You**: Up to 20 personalized recommendations based on watch history
  - **Latest Added**: Up to 20 newest content items
  - **Browse by Category**: Category selector cards for Live TV, Movies, and Series
  - **Settings**: Options menu access

### 2. Category Browsing Pages

**New Feature:**
- Dedicated category browsing pages for Live TV, Movies, and Series
- Clicking on a category selector card navigates to a page showing all categories for that content type
- Each category page displays channels grouped by their `groupTitle` (genre/category)

**Category Page Structure:**
```
Live TV Page:
├── Sports (channels sorted by number)
├── Entertainment (channels sorted by number)
└── News (channels sorted by number)

Movies Page:
├── Action (movies sorted alphabetically)
├── Comedy (movies sorted alphabetically)
└── Drama (movies sorted alphabetically)

Series Page:
├── Drama (series sorted alphabetically)
├── Comedy (series sorted alphabetically)
└── Sci-Fi (series sorted alphabetically)
```

### 3. Content Sorting

**Live TV:**
- Categories sorted alphabetically
- Channels within categories sorted by channel number/order
- Extraction of channel numbers from names for proper numerical sorting

**Movies & Series:**
- Categories sorted alphabetically
- Content within categories sorted alphabetically by title

### 4. Navigation Flow

**User Journey:**
1. User opens app → Home page with personalized content
2. User navigates down to "Browse by Category" row
3. User selects "Live TV", "Movies", or "Series" card
4. App navigates to dedicated category page
5. User browses categories and selects content
6. For Movies/Series: Details page shows with description and rating
7. For Live TV: Playback starts immediately

### 5. Navigation Bar Improvements

**Fixed Issues:**

- **D-Pad Left**: Return to sidebar from content
