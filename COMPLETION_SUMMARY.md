# Task Completion Summary

**Task:** Check app functionality and make sure it's ready for testing  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Comprehensive Code Review ✅
- Analyzed all 21 Kotlin source files (2,956 lines of code)
- Reviewed 7 XML layout files
- Examined build configuration and dependencies
- Verified all resources and string definitions
- Checked security implementations
- Assessed architecture and code quality

### 2. Bug Fixes ✅
Found and fixed 2 critical bugs that would have prevented compilation:

#### Bug #1: Missing Field in Channel Model
- **File:** `app/src/main/java/com/mattverwey/m3uplayer/data/model/Channel.kt`
- **Issue:** Missing `added` field referenced in `ChannelRepository.kt`
- **Impact:** Would cause compilation errors and break "Latest Added" feature
- **Fix:** Added `val added: String? = null` to Channel data class

#### Bug #2: Syntax Error in XtreamSeries
- **File:** `app/src/main/java/com/mattverwey/m3uplayer/data/model/XtreamCategory.kt`
- **Issue:** `releaseDate` field had value `nu` instead of `null`
- **Impact:** Would cause compilation errors preventing app from building
- **Fix:** Changed `releaseDate: String? = nu` to `releaseDate: String? = null`
