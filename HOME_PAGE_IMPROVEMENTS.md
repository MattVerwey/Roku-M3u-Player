# Home Page Navigation Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the M3U Player home page and navigation system to provide a better user experience after login.

## Problem Statement
The original requirements were:
1. Make categories easily navigatable
2. Add recently watched section on the home page
3. Create a proper home page when user logs in
4. Ensure navigation is intuitive and accessible

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Personalized Home Page
Created a comprehensive landing page with multiple content sections that appear after login:

#### Home Page Sections (in order):
1. **‚è±Ô∏è Recently Watched** (up to 20 items)
   - Shows most recently viewed channels/content
   - Automatically refreshes when returning from playback
   - Provides quick access to continue watching

2. **üí° Recommended For You** (up to 20 items)
   - Intelligent recommendations based on watch history
   - Uses existing RecommendationEngine with genre and category matching
   - Weighted by recency of watched content

3. **üÜï Latest Added** (up to 20 items)
   - Newest content added to the library
   - Sorted by timestamp for movies and series
   - Helps users discover new content

4. **üì∫ Live TV** (up to 30 items)
   - All live television channels
   - Direct playback on selection

5. **üé¨ Movies** (up to 30 items)
   - On-demand movie content
   - Shows details screen before playback

6. **üì∫ Series** (up to 30 items)
   - TV series and episodic content
   - Shows details with season/episode navigation

7. **‚öôÔ∏è Settings**
   - Access to app settings and controls
   - Refresh channels, privacy settings, logout

### 2. Navigation Improvements

#### Sidebar Menu
- Always starts visible for easy category access
- D-pad Up/Down to navigate between categories
- D-pad Left/Right to browse content within categories
- Visual highlighting of selected category

#### Settings Access
- Automatically opens settings menu when Settings row is focused
- No need to navigate into empty row
- Quick access to:
  - Refresh Channels
  - Privacy & Security Settings
  - Toggle viewing history tracking
  - Clear viewing history
  - Clear cache
  - Logout

#### Home Title
- Changed from "M3U Player" to "Home" for clearer context
- Added app icon badge for better branding
- Makes it clear this is the main landing page

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Code Changes
File: `app/src/main/java/com/mattverwey/m3uplayer/ui/browse/BrowseFragment.kt`

**Key Modifications:**
1. `setupUI()` - Changed title to "Home" and added badge icon
2. `setupRows()` - Restructured to create home page sections
3. `setupEventListeners()` - Added Settings menu trigger on row selection
4. `onResume()` - Added automatic row refresh to update Recently Watched

**Repository Methods Used:**
- `repository.getRecentlyWatchedChannels(channels)` - Gets recently watched items
- `repository.getRecommendations(channels, maxRecommendations)` - Gets personalized recommendations
- `repository.getLatestAddedContent(channels, limit)` - Gets newest content
- All methods already existed, no new repository logic needed

#### Data Flow
```
User logs in ‚Üí MainActivity checks credentials ‚Üí Shows BrowseFragment
    ‚Üì
BrowseFragment.loadChannels() ‚Üí Repository loads from cache/network
    ‚Üì
BrowseFragment.setupRows() ‚Üí Creates all home page sections
    ‚Üì
User navigates/watches content ‚Üí Recently Watched updated
    ‚Üì
onResume() ‚Üí Refreshes rows with updated Recently Watched
```

### 4. User Experience Benefits
