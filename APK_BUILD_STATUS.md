# APK Build Status & Next Steps

## 📋 Current Status

### Build System: ✅ Configured

The build configuration has been fixed and is ready to build APKs:

- **Gradle**: 8.2
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.1.4  
- **Kotlin**: 1.9.23
- **JDK**: 17
- **Target SDK**: 34
- **Min SDK**: 26 (Fire TV compatible)

### Issue Resolved: ✅ GitHub Actions Setup

**Problem**: This environment blocks access to `dl.google.com` (Google Maven repository), preventing local builds.

**Solution**: GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`) that builds APKs in an unrestricted environment.

### Workflow Status: 🟡 Awaiting Execution

The GitHub Actions workflow has been created and pushed, but is waiting to run:
- **Workflow**: Build Android APK
- **ID**: 202743473  
- **Run #1**: 18975187363
- **Status**: Awaiting approval / first-time run authorization

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Verify GitHub Actions Build ✅ Ready

**The workflow is configured to run automatically on:**
- Every push to `main`, `develop`, or `copilot/**` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

**To get the APK:**
1. Visit: https://github.com/MattVerwey/Roku-M3u-Player/actions/workflows/build-apk.yml
2. Click on the latest successful run (green checkmark)
3. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
4. Download `app-debug-apk.zip`
5. Extract `app-debug.apk`

**If workflow needs approval:**
- Repository owner may need to approve first-time workflow runs
- Go to Actions tab → Select the workflow → Click "Approve and run"

### 2. Test on Fire TV Device 📱

**Installation:**
```bash
# Enable ADB on Fire TV
# Settings → My Fire TV → Developer Options → ADB Debugging

# Connect from computer
adb connect <FIRE_TV_IP>:5555

# Install APK
adb install -r app-debug.apk
```

**Test with Free M3U Playlists:**
- USA Channels: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/us.m3u`
- News: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.category.m3u?category=news`
- Sports: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.category.m3u?category=sports`

### 3. Verify Core Functionality ✅

**Must Test:**
- ✅ App launches without crashing
- ✅ M3U URL login works
- ✅ Channels load and display
- ✅ Video playback starts within 3-5 seconds
- ✅ Remote control navigation (D-Pad) works
- ✅ Picture-in-Picture mode works

**UI/UX Checks:**
- ✅ Main menu is organized (Live TV, Movies, Series, Settings)
- ✅ Sidebar text is readable (white, not purple)
- ✅ Scrolling is smooth (60 FPS)
- ✅ Channel cards display properly
- ✅ No lag or freezing

### 4. Performance Testing 📊

**Expected Metrics:**
- Startup: < 2 seconds
- Channel Load: < 10 seconds  
- Playback Start: < 3 seconds
- Buffering: Minimal (60s buffer)
- Scrolling: 60 FPS
- Focus Change: < 100ms

### 5. Report Issues 🐛

If any issues found, create detailed reports including:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots/logs
- Device model and Android version

## 🔍 Known Issues from Previous Testing

According to `AGENT_TODO.md`, these were previous concerns:

1. **Main Menu Structure** - Should show 4 clear options (Live TV, Movies, Series, Settings)
2. **Remote Control** - D-Pad navigation must be responsive
3. **Sidebar Text** - Headers should be white (#FFFFFF), not purple/pink
4. **Category Organization** - Content should be grouped by genre/type
5. **Playback Stability** - No crashes during video playback

**These should be verified during testing.**

- ✅ **BUILD_NETWORK_ISSUE.md** - Why builds fail locally
- ✅ **TEST_PLAYLISTS.md** - Free M3U URLs for testing
- ✅ **TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Complete testing guide
