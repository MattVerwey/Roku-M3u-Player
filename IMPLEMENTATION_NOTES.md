## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Custom Controls vs ExoPlayer Default

**Decision**: Implement custom control overlay instead of using ExoPlayer's built-in controls.

**Rationale**:
- More control over layout and behavior
- Better Fire TV remote integration
- Custom auto-hide timing
- Ability to add context-specific buttons (TV guide, play next)

**Trade-offs**:
- More code to maintain
- Need to handle all remote key events manually
- Must implement our own progress bar (future enhancement)

### 2. Auto-Hide Timer Implementation

**Decision**: Use Android Handler with configurable delay (5 seconds).

**Implementation**:
```kotlin
private val handler = Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())
private var hideControlsRunnable: Runnable? = null

private fun resetHideControlsTimer() {
    hideControlsRunnable?.let { handler.removeCallbacks(it) }
    hideControlsRunnable = Runnable { hideControls() }
    handler.postDelayed(hideControlsRunnable!!, CONTROLS_HIDE_DELAY_MS)
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Simple and reliable
- Easy to cancel and reset
- Proper cleanup in onDestroy
- No memory leaks

### 3. EPG Data Source

**Decision**: Use iptv-org free EPG sources with fallback.

**Sources**:
- Primary: US - TVGuide.com EPG
- Fallback 1: UK - Sky.com EPG  
- Fallback 2: CA - TVGuide.com EPG

**Rationale**:
- Free and regularly updated
- Good coverage for major regions
- XMLTV standard format
- Reliable with multiple fallbacks

**Alternative Considered**: XMLTV.org
- Rejected: Less reliable, outdated data

### 4. Series Episode Navigation

**Decision**: Pass series info and credentials via intent extras.

**Implementation**:
```kotlin
intent.putExtra(EXTRA_SERIES_INFO, seriesInfo)
intent.putExtra(EXTRA_CREDENTIALS, credentials)
```

**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Allows helper class to be stateless
- Easy to test
- Parcelable for efficiency

**Alternative Considered**: Singleton repository
- Rejected: Would create memory leaks, harder to test

### 5. Track Selection Dialog

**Decision**: Use AlertDialog with single choice items.

**Rationale**:
- Native Android component
- Fire TV optimized
- Good D-pad navigation
- Familiar UX pattern

**Alternative Considered**: Custom dialog fragment
- Rejected: Over-engineering, more code to maintain

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Buffering Strategy

```kotlin
val loadControl = DefaultLoadControl.Builder()
    .setBufferDurationsMs(
        DefaultLoadControl.DEFAULT_MIN_BUFFER_MS,
        60000, // Max buffer 60 seconds
        2500,  // Buffer for playback 2.5 seconds
        5000   // Buffer for playback after rebuffer 5 seconds
    )
    .setPrioritizeTimeOverSizeThresholds(true)
    .build()
```

**Benefits**:
- Smooth playback with minimal rebuffering
- Quick startup (2.5s pre-buffer)
- Large buffer (60s) for network fluctuations
- Prioritizes time over size for consistent experience

### 2. Adaptive Streaming

```kotlin
val trackSelector = DefaultTrackSelector(this).apply {
    setParameters(
        buildUponParameters()
            .setMaxVideoSizeSd() // Start with SD
            .setForceHighestSupportedBitrate(false) // Allow adaptive
    )
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Fast startup with SD quality
- Automatic upgrade to HD
- Adapts to network conditions
- No manual intervention needed

### 3. Async EPG Loading

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    val result = epgService.downloadEPG()
    result.onSuccess { data ->
        epgData = data
        updateTVGuide()
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- No blocking of UI thread
- No impact on playback
- Automatic retry on failure
- Lifecycle-aware (no leaks)

### 4. Seamless Track Switching

ExoPlayer handles track switching internally without stopping playback. We just update the track selector parameters:

```kotlin
parameters.setTrackTypeDisabled(C.TRACK_TYPE_TEXT, false)
trackSelector.setParameters(parameters)
```

**Benefits**:
- No rebuffering
- Instant switching
- Maintains playback state
- No quality degradation
