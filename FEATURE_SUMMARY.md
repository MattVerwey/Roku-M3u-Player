## How Recommendations Learn

The more you watch, the smarter the recommendations get!

**Example:**

Day 1: You watch Breaking Bad
- System notes: "They like Crime and Drama"

Day 2: You watch The Godfather
- System notes: "Crime and Drama confirmed"

Day 3: Browse screen shows:
- **Better Call Saul** ← Perfect match! Crime + Drama + Series
- **Ozark** ← Great match! Crime + Drama
- **Narcos** ← Good match! Crime genre
- And 27 more suggestions...

**The system considers:**
- What genres you watch
- Whether you prefer Movies or Series
- How recently you watched something
- Quality ratings
- How new the content is

## Privacy First 🔒

All your data stays on YOUR device:
- ✅ Watch history stored locally
- ✅ Recommendations calculated on-device
- ✅ No data sent to external servers
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ Clear cache anytime (Menu → Clear Cache)

## Getting Started

**Nothing to configure!** The features work automatically.

Just:
1. Open the app
2. Browse your content
3. Start watching
4. Recommendations appear after your first watch

## Tips for Best Results

**For Better Recommendations:**
- Watch at least 5 different items
- Watch variety within genres you like
- Come back often (recent watches matter most)

**To Reset Everything:**
- Menu → Clear Cache
- This clears watch history and recommendations
- Fresh start whenever you want

## What Variables Track "Added" Content?

As requested, the system now tracks when content was added:

**In the code:**
```kotlin
channel.added  // The timestamp when content was added
```

**Where it's used:**
- VOD (Movies): `XtreamVOD.added` field from API
- Series: `XtreamSeries.last_modified` field from API
- Displayed in: "Latest Added" row
- Type: Unix timestamp as string (e.g., "1698765432")

## Troubleshooting

**"Latest Added" not showing?**
- Requires Xtream API to provide `added` field
- Try: Menu → Refresh Channels
- Some playlists don't include timestamps

**No recommendations?**
- Watch at least 1 item first
- Check: Menu → Clear Cache to reset

**Series not showing?**
- Requires Xtream Codes API (not M3U)
- Check your playlist includes series

**Recommendations seem off?**
- Watch more content (at least 5 items)
- System needs more data to learn
- Recent watches influence more than old ones
