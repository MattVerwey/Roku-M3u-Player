### Overall Status: ✅ **READY FOR TESTING** (with minor bugs fixed)

---

## Code Review and Bug Fixes

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Missing Field in Channel Model** ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue:** `Channel.kt` was missing the `added` field that was referenced in `ChannelRepository.kt`
   - **Impact:** Would cause compilation errors and prevent "Latest Added" content from displaying
   - **Fix:** Added `val added: String? = null` to the Channel data class
   - **Location:** `app/src/main/java/com/mattverwey/m3uplayer/data/model/Channel.kt`

2. **Syntax Error in XtreamSeries Model** ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue:** `releaseDate` field had incomplete value `nu` instead of `null`
   - **Impact:** Would cause compilation errors preventing the app from building
   - **Fix:** Changed `releaseDate: String? = nu` to `releaseDate: String? = null`
   - **Location:** `app/src/main/java/com/mattverwey/m3uplayer/data/model/XtreamCategory.kt`
