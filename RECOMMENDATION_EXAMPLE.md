### Final Recommendation Ranking

1. **Better Call Saul S01E01** - Score: 72.45 ‚≠ê Best Match
2. **Scarface** - Score: 69.15
3. **Extraction 2** - Score: 24.6
4. **The Big Bang Theory S01E01** - Score: 16.05

### Why Better Call Saul Wins

1. **Perfect Genre Match:** Matches user's top two genres (Crime, Drama)
2. **Category Preference:** User slightly prefers Series (8.0) over Movies (6.0)
3. **High Quality:** Excellent rating (8.9) adds bonus points
4. **Recency Effect:** User's recent Crime/Drama watching heavily influences score

### Why Extraction 2 Ranks Low

1. **Weak Genre Match:** Only Thriller matches (5.0 weight), Action doesn't match at all
2. **Partial Category Match:** Movie category, but user prefers Series
3. **Recent Release Bonus:** Helps but not enough to overcome genre mismatch
4. **Conclusion:** System correctly identifies this as not a good fit despite being new

## Real-World Behavior

As the user watches more content, the system adapts:

### After Watching 3 Action Movies

**Updated Weights:**
- Action: 5.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 = 11.0 (NEW)
- Crime: 14.0 (unchanged)
- Drama: 14.0 (unchanged)

**Extraction 2 New Score:**
```
Action match: 11.0 * 2.0 = 22.0 (was 0.0)
Thriller match: 5.0 * 2.0 = 10.0
Movie match: 9.0 + (new Movie watches) = higher
Rating: 3.6
Recent: 2.0

Total: ~46.6 (was 24.6) - Now ranks higher!
```

### After 30 Days Pass

**Recency Decay:**
- Original watches now have 1.0x weight (was 5.0x, 3.0x, 1.5x)
- Genre weights decrease proportionally
- Recent watches dominate recommendations
- System adapts to changing tastes

## Edge Cases

### New User (No Watch History)
- No recommendations shown
- Need at least 1 watch to generate recommendations
- System shows: Recently Watched, Latest Added, but not Recommended

### User Watches Only One Genre
- Recommendations heavily favor that genre
- Other genres get 0 score
- Encourages exploration of similar content

### User Watches Everything
- All genres have similar weights
- System falls back to rating and recency
- Shows highest-rated recent releases

### No Genre Information
- Genre matching skipped (0 score)
- Falls back to category preference, rating, recency
- Still provides useful recommendations

## Testing the Algorithm

To verify it works correctly:

1. **Test 1: Watch 5 Action movies**
   - Expect: Action movie/series recommendations dominate

2. **Test 2: Watch 3 Comedies, 2 Dramas**
   - Expect: Mixed recommendations favoring Comedy

3. **Test 3: Watch only Series**
   - Expect: Series recommendations even if genre matches movies

4. **Test 4: Watch 10 old items, 1 recent Sci-Fi**
   - Expect: Sci-Fi heavily weighted due to recency (5.0x)

5. **Test 5: Clear cache and restart**
   - Expect: No recommendations until you watch something
