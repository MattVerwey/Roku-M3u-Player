## 🔧 Want to Build Locally Instead?

If you prefer to build the APK on your own machine instead of using GitHub Actions, see **UNBLOCK_SITES_GUIDE.md** for instructions on:
- Unblocking `dl.google.com` and Maven repositories
- Configuring proxy settings
- Using VPN or mobile hotspot
- Pre-downloading dependencies for offline builds

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now:

### STEP 1: Approve the Build (2 minutes)

The GitHub Actions workflow is ready but needs your approval (first-time security feature):

1. Go to: **https://github.com/MattVerwey/Roku-M3u-Player/actions**
2. Click on "**Build Android APK**" workflow
3. You'll see pending runs (yellow/orange status)
4. Click "**Approve and run**" button
5. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete

### STEP 2: Download the APK (1 minute)

Once the build completes successfully (green checkmark):

1. Click on the successful workflow run
2. Scroll to bottom "**Artifacts**" section
3. Download "**app-debug-apk.zip**"
4. Extract "**app-debug.apk**" from the ZIP file

### STEP 3: Install on Fire TV (2 minutes)

```bash
# Enable ADB on Fire TV first:
# Settings → My Fire TV → Developer Options → ADB Debugging

# Connect from your computer:
adb connect <YOUR_FIRE_TV_IP>:5555

# Install the APK:
adb install -r app-debug.apk
```

**Or use Apps2Fire app for easier installation (no terminal needed)**

### STEP 4: Test with Free Playlist (2 minutes)

1. Launch "**M3U Player**" from Fire TV Apps
2. Select "**M3U URL**" login
